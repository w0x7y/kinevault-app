# Kine app branding

The launcher icon uses a large close-up of the blue Kine mascot, with its cream
antenna tips, navy eyes, and smile. The supplied Duolingo icon guided the face
framing. The iOS splash reuses the exact supplied waving mascot, with a wordmark
set in the app's Comfortaa font. The existing eleven in-app poses stay in
`../mascot/2d/`.

## Assets

| File | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `icon.png` | Opaque 1024px iOS icon and Android legacy icon; OS applies corners |
| `adaptive-foreground.png` | Transparent 1024px Android foreground with mask-safe inset |
| `adaptive-monochrome.png` | Android themed icon; eyes and smile are transparent cutouts |
| `favicon.png` | 48px web favicon |
| `splash-light.png` | Transparent 720px square iOS launch lockup with navy wordmark |
| `splash-dark.png` | Same layout with cream wordmark for dark mode |
| `splash-android.png` | Transparent 720px head mark for Android's square launch container |

`app.json` configures these assets. Splash backgrounds match the app's existing
light `#f6f7f9` and dark `#12171d` backgrounds. The Android adaptive background is
cream `#f8f2e3`. The head is exported within a 580px bounding box; its visible
pixels fit inside the 626px safe circle of a 1024px adaptive layer.
Both splash exports are square to match Expo's native image view.
The Android splash uses a separate head mark
to avoid clipping the tall wordmark inside the platform's launch icon container.

## Source and regeneration

The two PNGs in `source/` were generated with the built-in `image_gen` tool.
Exact prompts and reference roles are recorded in `prompts.json`. The waving
mascot comes from `../mascot/2d/source/kine-welcome.png`, which is byte-identical
to the user's uploaded `kine-welcome.png`.

To resize and export these source images, install ImageMagick and use the
project's installed Comfortaa font:

```sh
node scripts/export-branding.mjs
```

The script only writes this directory's exported PNGs. It does not regenerate
artwork, call an API, or change mascot poses. Source PNGs are not referenced by
the app config or imported by application code.

Open `../../design/branding.html` through a local HTTP server for a visual review
of the actual exported assets at launcher sizes and in splash layouts.

## Native verification

Icon and native splash changes require a new native binary. Expo Go cannot show
the final native splash: verify the launch screen in an installed release build.
The existing startup code already holds the splash until fonts, theme, and
profile state are ready, so no startup logic change is needed.
